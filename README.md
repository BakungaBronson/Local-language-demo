# Local-language-demo
This code simulates what an interaction with a Large Language Model (LLM) should flow like.
- We first take in the local language text, convert it to English which a large number of LLMs understand.
- We then use the English output as a prompt for the LLM and get an output.
- We then convert the output back to a local language and output it to the user.

## How to use?
